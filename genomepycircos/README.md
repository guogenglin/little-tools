This script automatically generates a circular genome map using PyCircos. It requires three input files: a genome in FASTA format, a genome annotation in GFF3 format, and the annotation results from EggNOG-mapper. Simply modify the file paths and the output path in the script, and the information you want to display in the center on the third-to-last line. then run it. Within seconds, youâ€™ll have a beautifully rendered genome map.
Here is a sample with the script.
